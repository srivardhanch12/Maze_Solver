# 🧩 Maze_Solver


A project that demonstrates solving mazes using **graph traversal algorithms** such as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.  
The application supports both **manual mode** (user-driven exploration) and **automatic mode** (algorithm-driven solution).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔹 **Automatic Mode** – Maze is solved using BFS or DFS.
- 🔹 **Manual Mode** – User can explore the maze manually.
- 🔹 Visual representation of pathfinding process.
- 🔹 Implementation of classical **Data Structures & Algorithms** concepts.

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  - Explores all possible paths level by level.  
  - Guarantees shortest path in an unweighted maze.  

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
  - Explores one path as deep as possible before backtracking.  
  - Efficient for small mazes but may not guarantee shortest path.

## 🎮 Modes of Operation

* **Manual Mode**: Use arrow keys / inputs to navigate inside the maze.
* **Automatic Mode**: Select BFS or DFS, and the algorithm will solve the maze automatically.
